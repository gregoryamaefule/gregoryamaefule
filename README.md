## About me

I'm Gregory Amaefule, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri. I will graduate with a specialization in Electronic and Computer Engineering. Apart from developing electronic and computer systems, I find pleasure in learning about building highly optimized software applications on the web and cloud. I love reading books, watching movies, and traveling. I aspire to one day employ my acquired skills and knowledge to develop impactful solutions for the African continent and beyond.
